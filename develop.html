        <p class="preformatted">
            Today I read pages 0-46 from the book "Develop in Swift AP CS Principles". This is my summary about Unit 1 Values: Computer programs and computers work with inputs and outputs. Input is the information we type into the computer, and output is the information the computer provides. The information can be in different types, like integers (numbers) or strings (text). Data consists of separate values, and computers process data to inspect values individually. Constants and variables were also covered; constants have stable values, while variables can change.

        </p>
        <p class="preformatted">
            Today I wrote my first code in Xcode that prints: "Hello, Ata". Here's the code:
        </p>
        <p class="preformatted">
            import UIKit<br>
            let greeting = "Hello "<br>
            let name = "Ata "<br>
            print("\(greeting)\(name)")
        </p>
        <p class="preformatted">
            I also created a Photo Frame app from Xcode (Couldn't be loaded yet). Additionally, I took notes from CollegeBoard videos on collaboration and computing innovations. Collaboration helps avoid bias and enhances problem-solving. Inputs can be tactile, visual, or audial, and programs react to specific inputs with corresponding code segments.

        </p>
        <p class="preformatted">
            Today I wrote an algorithm that suggests what to wear based on the weather. I also learned about different types of errors: logic, syntax, run-time, and overflow errors. I started coding my Scratch Connect4 game from an online tutorial.

        </p>
        <p class="preformatted">
            Today I finished coding jobs one, two, three, and four, and uploaded them to a GitHub repository. I also practiced my Swift skills by writing more code in Playgrounds. Access my Swift codes on GitHub via <a href="https://github.com/fahirataalaca/Playground">this repository</a>.

        <p class="preformatted">
            Today, I watched videos on binary code, overflow errors, and number systems. I learned about bits and bytes, binary digit representation, and abstraction in computing. I also filmed a presentation of what I understood from Big Idea 1. Access the video on <a href="https://fahirataalaca.github.io/videosite.github.io/">this page</a> and the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/fahirataalaca/videosite.github.io">here</a>.

        <h2>14.9.2024</h2>
        <p class="preformatted">
            Today I watched the videos of Big Idea 2. I learned that compression reduces the bits used to store data. Lossless compression retains the original data, while lossy compression removes parts that don't affect the representation. When collecting data, we should verify its accuracy and avoid bias. Metadata contains information about data, such as its author and processing date. Using graphs and charts can help organize and identify data efficiently.
