        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Problem 1: HTML code's website didn't appear in preview</span>
                <span>Solution: It doesn't appear in preview, you can only see it in the real website.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem 2: I don't know how to apply CSS code in GitHub</span>
                <span>Solution: CSS can be written in a style compartment in the same page with the actual HTML code.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem 3: My website isn't fully HTML code; it's written in a .md file (Not sure if this is a problem)</span>
                <span>Solution: I wrote my website in HTML code later on, so I didn't use .md files.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem 4: I don't know how to open an individual website for different files in a repository</span>
                <span>Solution: I included the names of .html files in my main index.html, linking to those specific websites.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem 5: I couldn't load Xcode projects on GitHub</span>
                <span>Solution: I created new playgrounds which linked to a different GitHub repository. Then, I transferred my codes into the new playgrounds and added a commit message before hitting commit.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem 6: When I tried to open my .html website, it showed a 404 Not Found Page</span>
                <span>Solution: I opened a new repository with only an index.html file in it. I wrote my HTML code there and had ChatGPT check it for errors. Once the home page (index.html) was functioning properly, I added the other required pages, ensuring no errors in their code as well. I also navigated to Related Repository > Settings > Pages > Set to Main and Root.</span>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Step 1: I thought I could build a Connect4 game by myself and started browsing through code blocks to get a basic idea of which codes I would use to build the program.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Step 2: I realized my Scratch knowledge wasn't enough to build such a game, so I started browsing through other Connect4 games on Scratch.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Step 3: I understood that a Connect4 game required many more code blocks than I originally thought after checking the codes of other games.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Step 4: I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crqXIsejoRA">tutorial</a> about creating a Connect4 game in Scratch from YouTube. I followed the tutorial and both learned more about Scratch and built a game. However, the code was too complex for me to fully understand. While I grasped some parts, I couldn’t comprehend others. Credits to "Just Finished Coding" for the tutorial.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Step 5: I finished my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1043484825/">Scratch Connect4 game</a> and uploaded the link to GitHub.</span>
