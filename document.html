        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Problem1: HTML code's website didn't appear in preview</span>
                <span>Solution: It doesn't appear in preview, you can only see it in the real website</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem2: I don't know how to apply CSS code in Github</span>
                <span>Solution: CSS could be written in a style compartment in the same page with the actual html code</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem3: My website isn't in fully HTML code, it is written in a .md file (Not sure if this is a problem)</span>
                <span>Solution: I wrote my website in HTML code later on so I didn't use .md files.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem4: I don't know how to open an individual website for different files in a repository</span>
                <span>Solution: I would just include the names of .html files in my main index.html and it would link to those specifically named websites.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem5: I couldn't load Xcode projects on GitHub</span>
                <span>Solution: I created new playgrounds which linked to a different GitHub repository and then transferred my codes into the new playgrounds. After that I added a commit message before hitting commit</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem6: When I tried to open my .html website, it showed a 404 Not Found Page</span>
                <span>Solution: I opened a new repository with only an index.html file in it. I wrote my HTML code there and made ChatGPT check it so there were no errors in the code. When the home page (index.html) was functioning right, I added the other required pages and made sure there were no errors in their code too. I also did Related Repository > Settings > Pages > Set to Main and Root</span>
