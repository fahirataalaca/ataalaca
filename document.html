        <h2>The problems I encountered and my solution</h2>
  <ul>
            <li>▻   
              Problem1: HTML code's website didn't appear in preview
                      Solution: It doesn't appear in preview, you can only see it in the real website
            </li>
      <p></p>
            <li>▻ 
             Problem2: I don't know how to apply CSS code in Github 
                     Solution: CSS could be written in a style compartment in the same page with the actual html code
            </li>
          <p></p>
            <li>▻ 
                Problem3: My website isn't in fully HTML code, it is written in an .md file (Not sure if this a problem) 
                        Solution: I wrote my website in HTML code later on so I didn't use .md files.
            </li>
        <p></p>
            <li>▻
            Problem4: I don't know how to open a individual website for diffrent files in a repository 
                    Solution: I would just include the names of .html files in my main index.html and it would link to those specifically named websites.
            
            </li>
        <p></p>
            <li>▻
            Problem5: I couldn't load Xcode projects on Git-Hub
                    Solution: I created new playgrounds which linked to a diffrent Git-Hub repository and then transferred my codes into the new playgrounds. After that I added a commit message before hitting commit
                  <p></p>
            <li>▻
            Problem6: When I tried to open my .html website, it showed a 404 Not Found Page
                    Solution: I opened a new repositroy with only a index.html file in it. I wrote my html code there and made ChatGPT check it so there are no errors in the code. When the home page (index.html) was functioning right, I added the other required pages and made sure there were no errors in their code too. I also did Related Repository > Settings > Pages > Set to Main and Root
