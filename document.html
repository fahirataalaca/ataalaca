                <span>Problem1: HTML code's website didn't appear in preview</span>
                <span>Solution: It doesn't appear in preview, you can only see it in the real website</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem2: I don't know how to apply CSS code in Github</span>
                <span>Solution: CSS could be written in a style compartment in the same page with the actual html code</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem3: My website isn't in fully HTML code, it is written in a .md file (Not sure if this is a problem)</span>
                <span>Solution: I wrote my website in HTML code later on so I didn't use .md files.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem4: I don't know how to open an individual website for different files in a repository</span>
                <span>Solution: I would just include the names of .html files in my main index.html and it would link to those specifically named websites.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem5: I couldn't load Xcode projects on GitHub</span>
                <span>Solution: I created new playgrounds which linked to a different GitHub repository and then transferred my codes into the new playgrounds. After that I added a commit message before hitting commit</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Problem6: When I tried to open my .html website, it showed a 404 Not Found Page</span>
                <span>Solution: I opened a new repository with only an index.html file in it. I wrote my HTML code there and made ChatGPT check it so there were no errors in the code. When the home page (index.html) was functioning right, I added the other required pages and made sure there were no errors in their code too. I also did Related Repository > Settings > Pages > Set to Main and Root</span>

               Step1: I tought I could build a connect4 game by myself and started to browse trough code blocks to having a basic idea about whit which codes I was going to build the program
            </li>
            <li>
                Step2: I realized that my Scratch knowledge wasn't enough to build such a game so I started browsing trough other connect4 games on Scratch. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Step3: I understood that a connect4 game required much more code blocks than I originally tought when I checked the codes of the other games.            </li>
            <li>
                Step4: I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crqXIsejoRA">tutorial</a>  about creating a connect4 game in scratch from youtube. I did what the video told me to do so I both learned more about Scratch and built a game. Unfortunately, the code was too big for me to fully understand so while I understood some parts of the code, I couldn't understand others. Credits to "Just Finished Coding" for the tutorial.
            </li>
            <li>
               Step5: I finished my  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1043484825/">Scratch Connect4 game</a> and uploaded the link to github
