        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there👋, I am Ata. I am currently a 10th grade student in Hisar School. I am currently taking AP Computer Science Principles. On of the main reasons that encouraged me taking this course was that computers, programming and codes were in every little part of our lives now. Thats why I tought that it would be a good idea to gain some knowledge about programming and the principles of computer science. In my free time I like improve my 3D printer, model useful parts for it using Fusion 360, spend time with my friends or play tennis.</p>
