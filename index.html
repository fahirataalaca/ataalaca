        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello thereüëã, I am Ata. I am currently a 10th grade student in Hisar School. I am currently taking AP Computer Science Principlesüíª. On of the main reasons that encouraged me taking this course was that computers, programming and codes were in every little part of our lives now. Thats why I tought that it would be a good idea to gain some knowledge about programming and the principles of computer science. In my free time I like improve my 3D printer, model useful parts for it using Fusion 360, spend time with my friends or play tennis.</p>
